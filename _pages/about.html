    <p>
      I&rsquo;m a machine learning researcher working towards artificial agents
      that can reason like humans. I am interested in developing neural networks
      capable of system-2 or cognitive processing in order to generalize better
      than current models can.
    </p>

    <p>
      My research is focused on what I see as the most direct paths to system-2 deep learning:
      reinforcement learning for discrete search,
      compositional representation learning,
      and emergent abilities of large language models.
    </p>

      Right now, I work at <a href="https://nv-adlr.github.io/">NVIDIA</a>
      on automated theorem proving with reinforcement learning, big transformers,
      and the <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">Lean theorem prover</a>.
      In the past, I&rsquo;ve worked in
      <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/">Anima Anandkumar&rsquo;s</a>
      lab at Caltech studying the differences between how transformers and tree-structured neural networks
      learn representations.
      Before that, I was at <a href="https://www.descarteslabs.com/">Descartes Labs</a>
      building <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05094">better unsupervised learning algorithms for satellite imagery</a>
      and <a href="https://medium.com/descarteslabs-team/descartes-labs-urban-trees-tree-canopy-mapping-3b6c85c5c9cc">finding trees</a>.
      I recently graduated from Caltech, where I taught
      <a href="https://github.com/maxwells-daemons/caltech-cs11-tensorflow">a class on deep learning</a>.
