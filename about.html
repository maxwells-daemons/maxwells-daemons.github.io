    <h1>Hello! I&#39;m Aidan.</h1>
    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <p>
      I&#39;m a machine learning researcher interested in models of attention
      and memory, as well as compositional neural networks. I&#39;m also
      curious about exploration and multi-agent cooperation in reinforcement learning.
      </p>

      <p>
      Right now, I&#39;m working in
      <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/">Anima Anandkumar&#39;s lab</a>
      on recurrent neural networks that learn to allocate and use scratch space.
      In the past, I&#39;ve worked with
      <a href="https://www.descarteslabs.com/">Descartes Labs</a>
       to understand satellite imagery with computer vision. I was recently
       an undergrad at Caltech.
