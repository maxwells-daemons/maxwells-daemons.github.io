    <h1>Hello! I&#39;m Aidan.</h1>
    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <p>
      I'm a machine learning researcher working towards neural networks that
      can reason like humans. I'm interested in models of attention and memory,
      dynamic and modular neural networks, discrete search problems, and systematic generalization.
      I'm also curious about exploration and multi-agent communication in reinforcement learning.

      Right now, I'm a research scientist at NVIDIA working on automated theorem proving with reinforcement learning.
      In the past, I've worked with
      <a href="https://www.descarteslabs.com/">Descartes Labs</a>
      to understand satellite imagery and <a href="https://medium.com/descarteslabs-team/descartes-labs-urban-trees-tree-canopy-mapping-3b6c85c5c9cc">find trees</a> with computer vision,
      as well as <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/">Anima Anandkumar&#39;s lab</a> at Caltech
      to study why neural networks have such a hard time learning arithmetic.
      I recently graduated from Caltech, where I studied computer science and taught <a href="https://github.com/maxwells-daemons/caltech-cs11-tensorflow">a class on deep learning</a>.
