    <h1>Hello! I&#39;m Aidan.</h1>
    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <p>
      I&#39;m a machine learning researcher interested in models of attention
      and memory, as well as modular neural networks that learn to reason in a structured way.
      I&#39;m also curious about exploration and multi-agent communication in reinforcement learning.
      </p>

      <p>
      Right now, I&#39;m working in
      <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/">Anima Anandkumar&#39;s lab</a> at Caltech
      on improving the abilities of neural networks to systematically generalize.
      In the past, I&#39;ve worked with
      <a href="https://www.descarteslabs.com/">Descartes Labs</a>
      to understand satellite imagery and <a href="https://medium.com/descarteslabs-team/descartes-labs-urban-trees-tree-canopy-mapping-3b6c85c5c9cc">find trees</a> with computer vision.
       I recently graduated from Caltech, where I studied computer science.
